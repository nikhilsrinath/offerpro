// documentLifecycle.js — when a quotation, proforma or invoice may be deleted,
// when it may be cancelled, and what cancelling it undoes.
//
// The rule a company's books need:
//
//   · A draft nobody has seen (a quotation or proforma never sent) is just a
//     draft. Delete it.
//   · A TAX INVOICE is never deleted. Its number is part of a GST series, and
//     a gap in that series is something the business has to explain; a
//     cancelled invoice keeps its number and is reported as cancelled.
//   · Anything the client has received is cancelled, not deleted, so the
//     record of what they were sent survives.
//   · Nothing is cancelled out from under money or a later document: money
//     received has to be dealt with first, and a converted document's
//     successor has to be cancelled first.
//
// Pure functions. InvoiceList does the writes.
