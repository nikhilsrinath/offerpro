// cashIntent.js — the chatbot's hands for the cash book.
//
// Everything here turns a sentence somebody typed into a cash-book entry, and
// says what still needs asking before one can be written. It is deliberately
// deterministic and free of the model: a row that lands in the ledger is not
// something to be guessed at by a language model whose output cannot be
// replayed, and an entry nobody confirmed is not an entry. The model stays on
// the reading side of the product; this file drives the writing side.
//
// A draft has exactly the shape of CashBook's own form state, so it can be
// written through the same orgStore sections — no second definition of what an
// entry is, and no second place to keep in step with the column guards in
// migrations 0038 and 0041.
