// documentConversion.js — how a quotation becomes a proforma or an invoice,
// and how a proforma becomes its tax invoice.
//
// Two roads out of an accepted quotation:
//
//   quotation ─→ proforma ─→ tax invoice    advance first, bill on delivery
//   quotation ─────────────→ tax invoice    bill straight away
//
// Which one is a judgement call, so the issuer picks. recommendTarget() only
// suggests, and every reason it gives is a fact read from this organization's
// own documents — a count, a term, a currency — never a guess.
//
// Pure functions. InvoiceList does the writes.
