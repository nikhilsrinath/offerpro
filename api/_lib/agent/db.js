 * `authenticated` with that user's auth.uid(): the same RLS policies, the same
 * app.* guards and the same permission matrix as the screen they would
 * otherwise have used. The agent cannot do anything the person could not do
 * by hand, because the database never learns it was the agent.
 *
 * Except for one header. A confirmed write carries `x-edgeos-agent-action:
 * <ai_actions.id>`, which PostgREST exposes to SQL as request.headers. 0068's
 * audit trigger reads it. And trusts it only if that id is a confirmed action
 * belonging to auth.uid(), to stamp the audit row `via = 'edgeai'`.
 *
 * The service role (supabaseAdmin) is used for the ai_actions log and the AI
 * meter only; see actions.js.
